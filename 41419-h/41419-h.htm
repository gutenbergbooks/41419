<h3>
<span>SIR ROBERT PEEL, AND HIS CLAIMS TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE LITERARY MEN OF
ENGLAND.</span>
</h3>

<p>
One of the most interesting of the recently published parts of Murray's
<cite>Reading for the Rail</cite> is unquestionably <cite>Theodore Hook, a Sketch</cite>,
which has been reprinted from the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, with some
additional notes. Of these there is one (at p. 62.) which presents us
with the following honorable and characteristic anecdote of the late Sir
Robert Peel:&mdash;</p>

<p>   "The writer of this sketch, now that Sir R. Peel is no more among
   us, takes this, perhaps his only opportunity of mentioning the
   generosity of that statesman's conduct towards Maginn. The Doctor
   having always retained the strong feelings of an Irish Orangeman,
   was one of those who condemned with severity Sir Robert's
   pro-Catholic policy of 1829; nor, perhaps was there any one
   writer of the time by whom the personal motives of the minister
   were more unmercifully dealt with. The Doctor assailed them with
   unwearied pertinacity, in various newspapers and magazines; but
   especially in rhymes only less galling than the fiercest of
   Swift's. He had never been personally acquainted with Peel, who
   could have known nothing about him so distinctly as this
   hostility. Yet when, a few years before Maginn's death, some of
   his friends were privately making a subscription to relieve him
   from some pressing difficulties, Sir Robert, casually hearing of
   it, immediately sent through the writer of this sketch, with a
   stipulation for secrecy, the sum of 100<i>l.</i> as a contribution to
   the fund. The writer believes that Sir Robert on various
   subsequent occasions interfered on the Doctor's behalf in a
   manner not less liberal, and with the same delicate precautions.
   At all events, when the doctor was near his end, Sir Robert
   forwarded for his use a similar benefaction of 100<i>l.</i> The writer
   has no reason to suppose that Maginn was ever aware of any of
   these kind deeds. It remains to be added that, some years after
   Dr. Maginn's death, his only son, on attaining the requisite age,
   received a cadetship in the East Indies from Sir Robert Peel's
   last government."&mdash;(1852.)</p>

<p>The perusal of this interesting passage has reminded us of a desire
which we felt most strongly at the time when the country lost the
distinguished man to whom it relates; and which we should then have
given expression to, but for the fear that in the multitude of projects
for doing honour to his memory then floating<a id="Page_434"></a> <span class="pagenum">[434]</span> before the public
eye, what we had to propose might not be received in the way which his
merits deserved.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel was pre-eminently a patron of English Literature and
literary men; and we hoped, and do still hope, to see a recognition of
his great claims in that special character on the part of the men of
letters in this country. The most appropriate that occurs to us would be
the erection of his bust or statue in the vestibule of that national
establishment, in the welfare and management of which he always took so
great an interest&mdash;we mean the British Museum.</p>

<p>The minister who, in terms alike honorable to himself and to the man of
letters to whom the dignity was offered, tendered a baronetcy to
Southey, and conferred upon him a pension of 300<i>l.</i> a year&mdash;who gave
the same amount to Wordsworth&mdash;who gave to James Montgomery 150<i>l.</i> a
year, and to Tytler, to Tennyson, and to M'Culloch, each 200<i>l.</i> a
year&mdash;who bestowed a pension upon Frances Brown, and gave a 100<i>l.</i> a
year to the widow of Thomas Hood&mdash;who gave the first appointment of his
first administration to a son of Allan Cunningham, and placed the sons
of Mrs. Hemans in the service of the Crown,&mdash;Sir Robert Peel, the man
and the minister who could thus recognise the claims of Literature,<a id="ure1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and not, like ministers of old, stipulate for a return in the political
support of those whom he so distinguished, was surely a person whose
memory the men of letters in this country should not be slow to honour.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ure1" class="label">[1]</a> We have confined our remarks to Sir Robert
      Peel's patronage of Literature; but that patronage was
      as liberally bestowed upon Science and Art. To him
      Mrs. Somerville and Sir M. Faraday were indebted
      for their pensions; and while his friendship with Lawrence,
      Wilkie, and Chantrey, and his patronage of Collins,
      Roberts, Stansfield, &amp;c., cannot be forgotten, his
      prompt and most kind response to poor Haydon's
      application for assistance, though addressed to him at
      a moment when plunged in the fiercest political struggle
      in which he was ever engaged, can never be forgotten.</p>


<p>Let us hope that the moment has arrived when they will do justice to him
who was so ready to recognise their claims. Let Lord Mahon or Mr.
Hallam, who enjoyed the friendship of Sir Robert Peel, step forward and
begin the good work. An appeal from either of them would arouse a host.
They would be supported by all who love Literature, from the highest to
the humblest. Who can doubt that the author of <cite>Coningsby</cite> and the
author of <cite>Don Carlos</cite> would rejoice at the opportunity, which would
thus be afforded them, of uniting to do honour to the memory of a
political opponent, in that character in which he deservedly won the
applause of all men&mdash;as the judicious and munificent
 <span class="smaller">PATRON OF THE LITERATURE OF OUR NATIVE COUNTRY</span>.</p>

<span class="bla">Notes.</span>

<h3>
<span>SITTING IN BEDE'S CHAIR.</span>
</h3>

<p>One of the most interesting antiquities of Jarrow Church,
Northumberland, is the chair of the Venerable Bede. It is preserved in
the vestry of the church, whither all brides repair as soon as the
marriage service is over, to seat themselves upon it. This, according to
the popular belief, will make them the joyful mothers of children; and
the expectant mothers (as I have been informed) would not consider the
marriage ceremony complete, until they had been enthroned in the
Venerable Bede's chair. The chair is very rude and substantial; made of
oak; in height, four feet ten inches; having an upright back, and sides
that slope off for the arms. According to the barbarous English fashion,
it is carved over with the nomenclature of all the vulgar obscurities of
the neighbourhood, whose sacrilegious penknives, together with the
wanton depredations of relic-hunters, have so "shorn" the chair of its
"fair proportions," that soon nothing but its attenuated form, "small by
degrees, and beautifully less," will be left for the future Childe
Harold to address with&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

                         <p> "Can it be,</p>
     <p> That this is all remains of thee?"</p>

</div>

<p>Every foreigner who has visited our churches and cathedrals cannot fail
to remark how the English love of popularity glares forth in its most
sickly form in this barbarous custom of writing and carving names upon
monuments, or other works of art. Every observant person, too, when he
sees John Smith's name and full address, scratched with painful and
elaborate accuracy upon the stern but noseless face of some alabaster
knight, while he wonders at the gratuitous trouble which John Smith has
taken, must deplore the want of education thus so lamentably evinced.
Happily, this vulgar taste (so far as our churches are concerned) is now
under some control; but, nevertheless, it is still sad to see&mdash;at
Lichfield, for example&mdash;that control obliged to take the visible shape
of railings, to prevent Messrs. Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson from
handing their names down to posterity on the life-like marble of
Chantrey's "Sleeping Children." I have heard that this mode of defacing
monuments took its rise in the time of the Protectorate; and I would
wish to put this in the form of a <em>Query</em>: Whether it was so, or no?
With the impression that it <em>was</em> the case, I have for many years past
examined the dates that accompanied names scratched upon monuments, and
never found a date earlier than the Protectorate. The subject seems
worth the inquiry.<a id="Page_435"></a> <span class="pagenum">[435]</span></p>

<p>To return to Bede's chair. It has often been engraved: but the best
representation of it that I know, is that by Mr. W. B. Scott, in his
<cite>Antiquarian Gleanings of the North of England</cite>. Besides his careful
etching of the present state of the chair, he also gives a suggestive
woodcut of its restoration. The ornamental portion he confines to the
front of the seat, and the head of the chair.</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> piece in the volume of MS. poetry referred to in my
communication in Vol. v., p. 387., may perhaps be deemed of sufficient

and appears to me worthy of notice from its quaintness both in style and

<h3>
<span>ON A PASSAGE IN "MEASURE FOR MEASURE," ACT I. SC. 1.</span>
</h3>


<p>Dr. Johnson long since observed that "there is perhaps not one of
Shakspeare's plays more darkened than this by the peculiarities of its
author, and the unskilfulness of its editors, by distortions of phrase,
or negligence of transcription."</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we cannot be surprised that we are favoured
with three pages of notes on the following passage, which occurs in the
opening scene:</p>

<div class="poem">

   <div class="stanza">

     <p>"<i>Duke.</i> Escalus.</p>

   </div>

   <div class="stanza">

     <p>"<i>Escal.</i>      <span class="right1">    My lord.</span></p>

   </div>

   <div class="stanza">

      <p> "<i>Duke.</i> Of government the properties to unfold,</p>
      <p> Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse:<a id="Page_436"></a> <span class="pagenum">[436]</span></p>
      <p>Since I am put to know, that your own science</p>
      <p>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</p>
      <p>My strength can give you: Then no more remains</p>
      <p>But that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</p>
      <p>And let them work."</p>

  </div>

 </div>



<p>I must refer those who are desirous of seeing the various attempts to
extract a meaning from this passage to the Variorum Edition, and content
myself with those of the two latest editors, Mr. Collier and Mr. Knight.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "This passage is evidently corrupt, as is shown both by the metre
   and the sense. The latter will be cleared by the omission of the
   preposition 'to:' 'then no more remains [to be said], but that
   your sufficiency, as your worth is able, and let them work.' This
   change, however, will only partially cure the defective measure;
   and even were we to omit 'that,' as well as 'to,' the line would
   not be perfect without reducing 'sufficiency' to a trisyllable.
   It has been thought best, therefore, to leave the text as it
   stands in the first folio. 'Sufficiency' is adequate authority."</p>

<p>Mr. Knight says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "We encounter at the onset one of the obscure passages for which
   this play is remarkable. The text is usually printed thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

                      <p>"'Then no more remains</p>
      <p>But that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</p>
     <p> And let them work.'</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquot">"It is certainly difficult to extract a clear meaning from this;
   and so Theobald and Hanmer assume that a line has dropped out,
   which they kindly restore to us, each in his own way. The
   emendation which Steevens proposes is much less forced: 'Then'
   (says the Duke), 'no more remains to say,</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"'But your sufficiency as your worth is able,</p>
      <p>And let them work.'</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">"It is not our purpose to remove obscurities by additions or
   omissions, and therefore we leave the passage as in the original,
   excepting a slight alteration in the punctuation. We believe it
   may be read thus, without much difficulty. '<em>Then no more
   remains</em> (to say on government) <em>But that</em>, (your science) <em>to
   your sufficiency</em>, (joined to your authority) <em>as your worth</em> (as
   well as your virtue) <em>is able</em> (equal to the duty), <em>and let them
   work</em> (call them into action).'"</p>


<p>I cannot say that this exposition (paraphrastic as it is) is clear to
me; and I feel confident that our great poet never wrote the words "But
that," following as they do "Exceeds in that." What does "But that"
refer to? It cannot refer to "science," as Mr. Knight imagines. The
remedy lies in a very trifling correction of the press. In the MS. from
which the play was printed, the words "But th<span class="topnum">r</span>to" were thus written,
and the compositor mistook "th<span class="topnum">r</span>" for "th<span class="topnum">t</span>;" there is no comma
after <em>that</em> in the old copies. Replace "thereto" and the passage is
perfectly clear as to sense.</p>

<div class="poem">

                    <p class="i5">"Then no more remains</p>
      <p class="noindent">But <em>thereto</em> your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</p>
      <p class="noindent">And let them work."</p>

</div>

<p>It may be necessary to show that the word I propose would be used by the
poet just in the sense required here. The following passage from the
<cite>Winter's Tale</cite>, Act I. Sc. 2., will, I think, place it beyond doubt:</p>

<div class="poem">
                           <p class="i5">"Camillo,</p>
 <p class="noindent"> As you are certainly a gentleman, <em>thereto</em></p>
 <p class="noindent">Clerk-like experienc'd, which no less adorns</p>
 <p class="noindent">Our gentry, than our parents' noble names,</p>
 <p class="noindent">In whose success we are gentle," &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>I take the sense of the whole passage thus: "Since I must acknowledge
that you are better skilled in the nature of <em>government</em> than I am, it
would be idle in me to lecture you on the subject. Then nothing more is
wanting but <em>thereto</em> your sufficient authority (<i>i.e.</i> to govern), as
you have the ability, and let them (your skill and authority) come into
operation."</p>

<p><em>Sufficiency</em>, as Warburton long ago observed, is <em>authority</em>, but may
possibly be here used in the Latin sense of <em>substitution</em>. Escalus is
to be Vice-gerent. The very slight change necessary, and the great
probability of the occurrence of the error, strongly recommend this
simple emendation.</p>

<p>Daily experience is manifesting how large a portion of the difficult
passages are errors of the printer of the first folio, the two happy
corrections lately given in <cite>The Athenæum</cite>, for instance: who can doubt
that in <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, Act III. Sc. 1., "Bosome-multi<em>p</em>lied" should be
"Bissom-multitude:" or that, in <cite>All's Well that Ends Well</cite>, Act V. Sc.
3., "infuite comming" should be "infinite cunning?" A glance at the
passages as they stand in the old print of the first folio would
convince the most sceptical. A list of mere printer's errors in that
book would be not a little astounding.</p>

<h3>
<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span>Sites of Buildings mysteriously changed.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It may be amusing to the
readers of "N. &amp; Q.," and attended with some useful result, to record a
few popular traditions respecting the mysterious opposition to the
building of certain edifices on the spots originally designed for them
by their founders. I will introduce the subject with the local
traditions about the building of three churches well known to myself.</p>

<p>1. The church of Breedon, in Leicestershire, stands alone on a high
hill, the village being at its foot. The hill is so steep on the side
towards the village, that a carriage can only ascend by taking a very
circuitous course; and even the footpath winds considerably, and in some
parts ascends by steps formed in the turf. The inconvenience<a id="Page_437"></a> <span class="pagenum">[437]</span> of
such a situation for the church is obvious, and the stranger, of course,
wonders at the folly of those who selected a site for a church which
would necessarily preclude the aged and infirm from attending public
worship. But the initiated parishioner soon steps forward to enlighten
him on the subject, and assures him the pious founder consulted the
convenience of the village, and assigned a central spot for the site of
the church. There the foundation was dug, and there the builders began
to rear the fabric; but all they built in the course of the day was
carried away by <em>doves</em> in the night, and skilfully built in the same
manner on the hill where the church now stands. Both founder and
workmen, awed by this extraordinary interference, agreed to finish the
edifice thus begun by doves.</p>

<p>2. The parish church of Wendover, in Buckinghamshire, stands nearly half
a mile from the town. The church was to have been placed on a field
adjoining the town, and there the building of it was begun; but the
materials were all carried away in the night by witches, or, as some
relate the tradition, by fairies, and deposited where the church now
stands. The field in which the church was to have been built is still
called "Witches' Meadow."</p>

<p>3. The parish church of Winwick, Lancashire, stands near that
miracle-working spot where St. Oswald, king of the Northumbrians, was
killed. The founder had destined a different site for it, but his
intention was overruled by a singular personage, whose will he never
dreamed of consulting. It must here be noticed that Winwick had then not
even received its name; the church, as not uncommon in those days, being
one of the earliest erections in the parish. The foundation of the
church, then, was laid where the founder had directed, and the close of
the first day's labour showed the workmen had not been idle, by the
progress made in the building. But the approach of night brought to pass
an event which utterly destroyed the repose of the few inhabitants
around the spot. A pig was seen running hastily to the site of the new
church; and as he ran he was heard to cry or scream aloud "We-ee-wick,
We-ee-wick, We-ee-wick!" Then, taking up a stone in his mouth, he
carried it to the spot sanctified by the death of St. Oswald, and thus
employing himself through the whole night, succeeded in removing all the
stones which had been laid by the builders. The founder, feeling himself
justly reproved for not having chosen that sacred spot for the site of
his church, unhesitatingly yielded to the wise counsel of the pig. Thus
the pig not only decided the site of the church, but gave a name to the
parish.</p>

<p>In support of this tradition, there is the figure of a pig sculptured on
the tower of the church, just above the western entrance; and also the
following Latin doggerel:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Hic locus, Oswalde, quondam placuit tibi valde;</p>
      <p>Northanhumbrorum fueras Rex, nuncque Polorum</p>
      <p>Regna tenes, loco passus Marcelde vocato."</p>

</div>

<p>May not the phrase "Please the pigs" have originated in the above
tradition, since the founder of Winwick Church was obliged to succumb to
the pleasure of his porkish majesty?</p>

<p>Instances of equally marvellous changes in the sites of buildings are
recorded in Bede, and other monkish writers. Perhaps it would not be
difficult to unravel the mystery of such changes.</p>

<h4>
<span>Burning the Bush.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;While in Herefordshire last spring, I noticed a
singular custom in the agricultural districts. When the wheat is just
springing out of the ground, the farmer's servants rise before daybreak,
and cut a branch of thorn of a particular kind. They then make a large
fire in the field, in which they burn a portion of it; the remaining
part is afterwards hung up in the house. They do this to prevent the
smut, or mildew, affecting the wheat.</p>

<h4>
<span>Essex Superstition.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;An uncle of mine, who has a large farm near
Ilford, tells me, that observing a horse-shoe nailed to the door of one
of his cow-houses, he asked the cow-keeper why he had fixed it there.
The lad gravely replied, "Why, to keep the wild-horse away, to be sure."
This is, to me, a new reason for the practice.</p>

<p>I have learned that the superstition about the bees deserting their
hives on the death of one of their owner's family, is common in the same
county. A lady tells me, that calling upon some poor people who lived at
Hyde Green, near Ingatestone, she inquired after the bees. The old woman
of the house replied, "They have all gone away since the death of poor
Dick; for we forgot to knock at the hives, and tell them he was gone
dead."</p>

<h3>
<span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span>
</h3>


<h4>
<span>Boston and Bunker's Hill.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the plan of Boston, among the maps of
the Useful Knowledge Society, is to be found, near Charleston, and on
Breed's Hill (the real site of the battle usually misnamed as of
Bunker's Hill), the following notice, "Defeat of the British, 1775." My
first idea was, that, <em>Liberal</em> though the Society might be, it was
being rather too liberal to give away in this manner a victory which,
however bloody and fruitless, was indubitably ours: but, on second
thoughts, it seemed that the whole fault arose from copying too
implicitly an American map. Now I am well aware that a very large part
of the Americans, from continually vaunting (and with good reason) the
valour they displayed, and the honour they acquired, on that occasion,
have gradually worked themselves into the belief that they were the
victors, even though their own historians tell a different tale; and
they have even placed inscriptions on the monuments standing on the site
of the intrenchments from which they were forced by the British; which
inscriptions also assert a similar claim. This would be of no great
consequence had it been confined to themselves; but its being
transferred to an English publication not only tends to mislead many
persons on this side, but enables the Americans to refer with confidence
to it, as an admission of <em>their</em> victory on the part of the British;
and no one who remembers the use they made, on the Oregon Question, of a
similarly occasioned error in one of the Society's globes, can doubt
that our Transatlantic friends would make the most of this trifling
affair in confirmation of their claims to the victory.</p>

<h4>
<span>Snooks.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This name, so generally associated with vulgarity, is only a
corruption, or rather a contraction, of the more dignified name of
<em>Sevenoaks</em>. This town is generally called <em>Se'noaks</em> in Kent; and the
further contraction, coupled with the phonetic spelling of former days,
easily passed into <em>S'nooks</em>. This is no imaginary conclusion, for I am
told by a trustworthy friend that Messrs. Sharp and Harrison,
solicitors, Southampton, have recently had in their possession a series
of deeds in which all the modes of spelling occur from <em>Sevenokes</em> down
to <em>S'nokes</em>, in connexion with a family now known as <em>Snooks</em>.</p>

<h4>
<span>Last Slave sold in England.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents tell me
the date of the last public slave sale in England? Till the
establishment of Granville Sharpe's great principle, in 1772,
announcements of these are by no means uncommon. The following, from the
<cite>Public Ledger</cite> of Dec. 31, 1761, grates harshly upon the feelings of
the present generation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p class="center"> "FOR SALE:</p>

<h4>
<span>Hoax on Sir Walter Scott.</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;The following passage occurs in one of Sir
W. Scott's letters to Southey, written in September, 1810:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "A witty rogue, the other day, who sent me a letter subscribed
   'Detector,' proved me guilty of stealing a passage from one of
   Vida's Latin poems, which I had never seen or heard of; yet there
   was so strong a general resemblance as fairly to authorise
   'Detector's' suspicion."</p>

<p>Lockhart remarks thereupon:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "The lines of Vida which 'Detector' had enclosed to Scott, as the
   obvious original of the address to 'Woman' in <cite>Marmion</cite>, closing
   with&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"'When pain and anguish wring the brow,</p>
      <p>A ministering angel thou!'</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquot">"end as follows: and it must be owned that if Vida had really
   written them, a more extraordinary example of casual coincidence
   could never have been pointed out.</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="noindent">  "'Cum dolor atque supercilio gravis imminet angor,</p>
            <p>Fungeris angelico sola ministerio.'</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span>IRISH QUERIES.</span>
</h3>


<p>1. O'Donovan, in his edition of the <cite>Post-Invasion Annals of the IV.
Masters</cite>, vol. iii. p. 2091. note, says that he "intends to publish a
review of Spenser's <cite>View of the State of Ireland</cite>, in which he will
give him full credit for his discernment of abuses, and expose all his
intentional figments." Query, Has this review since appeared in any
Irish periodical, or other publication?</p>

<p>2. What is the relationship (or may it possibly be the <em>identity</em>?)
between Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who married a daughter of
William, Earl Marshal, the famous Protector, during Henry III.'s
minority, and Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who married a
daughter of King Edward I.?</p>

<p>3. The inquirer will consider himself extremely indebted to any one who
will inform him of the existence of a set of Middle-Age Maps of the
countries of Europe, of 8vo. or small 4to. size, published in England,
<cite>France</cite>, or <cite>Germany</cite>, in print, or easily to be had second-hand, <em>more
or less accurate</em>.</p>

<p>Koch's <cite>Révolutions de l'Europe</cite>, tome iii., Paris, 1814, gives seven
maps of the whole continent and its adjacent islands, at the following
periods of Middle-Age history:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> (1.) Avant l'Invasion des Barbares;</p>
     <p> (2.) Vers la Fin du V<span class="topnum">e</span> Siècle;</p>
     <p> (3.) Sous l'Empire de Charlemagne;</p>
     <p> (4.) Vers la Fin du IX<span class="topnum">e</span> Siecle;</p>
     <p> (5.) Vers 1074;</p>
     <p> (6.) Vers 1300:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which contain, of course, but few names of places. Were Europe divided
into five unequal parts, say, 1. The Northern Countries; 2. The British
Isles; 3. The Germanic Countries, Hungary, &amp;c.; 4. France and Spain; 5.
Italy, Turkey, &amp;c.; and maps of these five parts given, the Northern
Countries at three periods, the British Isles at four ditto, and the
others at seven periods, as above, we should require twenty-eight maps
(not too great a number, as the King's College <cite>Modern Atlas</cite>, of a
convenient size, has twenty-five), which if they contained names of
places as closely packed as the King's College <cite>Atlas</cite>, and laid down
from Spruner, or some other trustworthy authority, would soon, it may be
said without much foresight, be in the hands of so many readers of
history, as to answer thoroughly to any bookseller undertaking to bring
them out.</p>

<p>4. A copy of O'Brien's <cite>Irish-English Dictionary</cite>, <em>first</em> edition,
4to., old, half-calf, margins a little water-stained, otherwise perfect
and clean, lately priced at 25<i>s.</i>, to be exchanged for a clean copy of
the edition of 1832 (inferior in value but more portable), and a clean
copy of Thady Connellan's elementary <cite>Irish Dictionary</cite>, published by
Wall, Temple Bar; Hatchard, and Rivingtons: or the latter will be

<h4>
<span>The Azores.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a note in <cite>Our Village</cite> (vol. v.), Miss Mitford says
that this name was given to these islands collectively, on account of
the number of hawks and falcons found on them. Is the name Spanish; and
does the Natural History of the islands at the present time confirm the
assertion?</p>

<h4>
<span>Johnny Crapaud.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In one of Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe books is the
following entry of a trinket, devised at the period of the Duke of
Alençon's courting her Majesty:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Item, one little Flower of gold, with a <em>Frog</em> thereon; and
   therein mounseer his physnomie, and a little Pearl pendant."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "'Query,' says Miss Strickland (<cite>Queens</cite>, vol. vi. p. 471., 1st
   edit.), 'was this whimsical conceit a love-token, from the Duke
   of Alençon to his royal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle amie</i>, and the frog designed, not
   as a ridiculous, but a sentimental allusion to his country?'"</p>

<p>To which Query I would add another: When was the term of <em>Johnny
Crapaud</em> first applied to the French people, and on what occasion? I am
aware of the notion of its being on account of their said partiality for
eating frogs; which, by the bye, having tasted, I can pronounce to be
very good: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais chacun à son goût</i>. Is the frog introduced in the arms
of Anjou or Alençon?</p>

<p>&mdash;The fine moral poems which first appeared
in the <cite>Spectator</cite>, e.g. that commencing "When all thy mercies, O my
God;" the version of the Twenty-third Psalm, "The Lord my pasture shall
prepare;" "The spacious firmament on high," &amp;c., are, as most of our

of poetical pieces, however, I have seen them attributed to Andrew
Marvell. Can any of your readers certify either of these contradictory

<span>Old John Harries, "Bishop of Wales."</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have "An Elegy to the Memory
of the late worthy<a id="Page_440"></a> <span class="pagenum">[440]</span> and pious Mr. John Harries of Amleston, in
Pembrokeshire, Preacher of the Gospel;" from which it appears that,
after devoting himself to preaching for forty-six years, through both
North and South Wales, and more particularly in "Roose, Castlemartin,
Pembroke, Haverfordwest, Narberth, Woodstockslop, and Amleston," he died
at Newport on the 7th of March, 1788. Will you allow me to ask your
numerous correspondents whether any of them can assist me in tracing his
pedigree? One of his sons, a minor canon of Bristol, bore the arms of
Owen Gwynedd, viz. "vert, three eagles displayed on a fesse, or," on his
book-plate. He was often called the "Bishop of Wales," from the large
district through which he <em>overlooked</em> the progress of the Gospel.</p>

<h4>
<span>Black Rood in Scotland&mdash;Cross Neytz.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Observing that in Vol. ii. of
"N. &amp; Q." pp. 308. 409., and in Vol. iii., p. 104., there is a
discussion about the "Black Rood of Scotland," which does not seem to be
very satisfactorily concluded, I am tempted to send you a passage from
Madox's <cite>Baronia Anglica</cite>, p. 268., &amp;c., which seems to bear upon the
point in question, but I am not competent to say how far it may serve to
throw any light upon the obscurities of the case.</p>

<p>It there appears that 13th Oct. 1306, James Steward of Scotland swore
fealty to King Edw. I.:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"By his corporal oath, taken upon the consecrated body of Christ;
   and upon <em>the two holy crosses</em>, to wit, the <em>cross Neytz</em>, and
   the <em>Blakerode Descoce</em>, and other holy reliques."</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "In the priory of Lanrecost, in the diocese of Carlisle, before
   W. Bp. of Lichfield and Coventry, the King's Chancellor; and in
   the presence of Adomar de Valence."</p>

<p>I perceive in one of your communications, there is mention of the
<em>English Cross, the Cross Nigth</em>, which in Madox is called "the Cross
Neytz." Perhaps some of your antiquarian correspondents will favour us
with some explanation of this cross.</p>

<p>I should wish moreover to elicit some further particulars of <em>Thomas
Madox, the Historiographer Royal</em>, who has so well deserved of all
lovers of ancient English history by the four books in folio which he
has left us: especially his <cite>Formulare Anglicanum</cite>, and that work of
prodigious industry and research, his <cite>History of the Exchequer</cite>. There
is some account in Nichols' <cite>Lit. Anecdotes</cite>, but I should wish to see
some more particulars of his life and studies, and a more exact critique
upon his several works.</p>

<h4>
<span>Frebord.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I want information on this matter, and consider "N. &amp; Q."
peculiarly the place wherein to seek it, because it is a matter mainly
dependent on local custom. All the notice of Frebord that I have been
able to discover in books is derived from Dugdale. For instance, in
Jacob's <cite>Law Dictionary</cite>, ed. 1807, I read&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Frebord, <em>Franchordus</em>, ground claimed in some places more or
   less, beyond, or without the fence. It is said to contain two
   foot and a half."</p>

<p class="author1"><cite>Mon. Ang.</cite>, tom. ii. p. 141.</p>

<p>I heard, the other day, of a Warwickshire gentleman who claimed ten or
twelve feet; but the immediate reason for my Query is a claim at present
under the notice of a friend of mine is for sixty-six feet freebord! Is
not such a claim preposterous?</p>

<h4>
<span>The Stature of Queen Elizabeth.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a book entitled
<cite>Physico-Theology</cite>, being the substance of sixteen sermons preached in
St. Mary-le-Bone Church, London, at the Honourable Mr. Boyle's lectures
in 1711 and 1712, with notes, &amp;c., by the Rev. W. Derham (a <em>second
edition</em>, with additions, published in 1714), the authors, in treating
of the stature and size of man's body, says there is great<a id="Page_441"></a> <span class="pagenum">[441]</span> reason
to think the size of man was always the same from the Creation; and in a
note at page 330., after quoting Dr. Hakewill's <cite>Apolog.</cite> and other
authorities, concludes with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Nay, besides all this probable, we have some more certain
   evidence. Augustus was five foot nine inches high, which was the
   just measure of our famous Queen Elizabeth, who exceeded his
   height two inches, if proper allowance be made for the difference
   between the Roman and our foot."</p>

<h4>
<span>Inscription by Luther.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In looking at some of the old books in the
library of the British Museum, I observed, on the fly-leaf of an old
Bible, an inscription by Martin Luther, the meaning of which was the
following:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Elijah the prophet said, the world had existed 2000 years before
   the law (from Adam to Moses); would exist 2000 years under the
   Mosaic dispensation (from Moses to Christ), and 2000 years under
   the Christian dispensation; and then the world would be burnt."</p>

<p>The manuscript was in German and very much effaced, so that I am not
able to remember the words, though I very well remember the meaning.</p>

<p>Could any reader inform me in what part of the Bible this prophecy of
Elijah's is to be found? for I have searched for it in vain.</p>

<h4>
<span>"O Juvenis frustra," &amp;c.</span>

<h4>
<span>All-fours.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Macaulay's essay on Southey's edition of <cite>The Pilgrim's
Progress</cite> (Longman &amp; Co., p. 184.) occurs a curious use of this
expression:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The types are often inconsistent with each other; and sometimes
   the allegorical disguise is altogether thrown off.... It is not
   easy to make a simile go on all-fours. But we believe that no
   human ingenuity could produce such a centipede as a long allegory
   in which the correspondence between the outward sign and the
   thing signified should be exactly preserved. Certainly no writer
   ancient or modern has achieved the adventure."</p>

<p>This meaning I cannot find in Bailey's <cite>Dictionary</cite>, and it has escaped
the curious vigilance of Blakie's compilers. The saying, however, is a
very old one. Sir Edward Coke employs it (<cite>Coke upon Littleton</cite>, lib. i.
c. 1. sect. 1. p. 3. <i>a.</i>):</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "But no simile holds in everything; according to the ancient
   saying, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullum simile quatuor pedibus currit</i>."</p>

<p>There is a marginal reference here to 1 Hen. VII. 16.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your philological correspondents can throw some light on
the origin of the phrase, or at least give me some other examples of its
use. Is the expression "To be on all-fours with" good English?</p>

<h4>
<span>Richard, second Son of the Conqueror,</span>
</h4>

<p> is said by Hume, and by some
minor writers after him, to have been killed by a stag in the New
Forest; but William of Malmesbury and Roger of Wendover both say that he
died of fever, consequent on malaria, which struck him while hunting
there. This is well known to be of frequent occurrence in the
neighbourhood of desolated human dwellings; and thus seems to involve
even a more striking instance of retributive justice than the fate which
Hume assigns to him. The fatality attending most of this name in our
history is singular. Of nine princes (three of them kings) who have
borne the name of Richard, seven, or, if Hume is right, eight, have died
violent deaths, including four successive generations of the House of
York.</p>

<h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent's mention of my <cite>Arithmetical

which has never obtained the slightest answer&mdash;Who was Francis
Walkinghame, and when was his work on arithmetic first published? The
earliest edition I know of is the twenty-third, in 1787; but I am told,
on good authority, that Mr. Douce had the sixteenth edition of 1779.</p>

<h4>
<span>Optical Phenomenon.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I shall be much obliged to anybody who will
explain a phenomenon which I have observed.</p>

<p>Suppose 1. A street from twenty to thirty feet broad.</p>

<p>2. At the open window of a house on one side stands a man looking at the
corresponding window of the house on the opposite side; that is, he
looks at what was a window, but is now filled up with a large board that
is covered with an inscription of short lines, black on white; in short,
just such a board as one sees at a turnpike gate.</p>

<p>3. From shortness, or defect, of sight (I cannot say which), the man is
unable to read the inscription as he stands at his window.</p>

<p>4. He sits down on a low seat, so as to bring his eye almost close to,
and just on a level with, the sill of his own window. He then slowly
raises and depresses his head. As he does this, it of course appears to
him as if his own window-sill travelled up and down the board
opposite.<a id="Page_442"></a> <span class="pagenum">[442]</span></p>

<p>5. In doing so it comes successively under each line of the inscription.</p>

<p>6. As it does so, that one line becomes perfectly legible.</p>

<h4>
<span>Abraham-Men.</span>

<p>&mdash;Although I cannot find it in your former volumes, nor in
your Index, I think there was an inquiry in one of your past Numbers as
to the meaning of the phrase "<em>To sham Abraham</em>."</p>

<p>If there has been any reply, will you be good enough to refer me to it?
as it may explain the passage in Burton's <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>, that
"every village almost will yield dummerers <em>Abraham-men</em>," &amp;c.

<p class="blockquot">["To sham Abraham" is a cant expression, having reference to the

   particulars of the habits of this class of impostors. "She's all
   Abram," that is, quite naked. "What an Abram!" an exclamation for
   a ragged fellow. "An Abraham-man" was an impostor who personated
   a poor lunatic called Tom of Bedlam: one of this class is
   described by Shakspeare in his <cite>Lear</cite>, Act II. Sc. 3.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  [<em>Shakes</em>, as used in the following passage by Byron, is a
   vulgarism, which probably may be traced to the custom of
   <em>shaking</em> hands, the <em>shake</em> being estimated according to the
   value set upon the person giving it, and hence applied to the
   person. Byron writing to Murray, Sept. 28, 1820, says, "I had my
   hands full, and my head too just then (when he wrote <cite>Marino

<h3>
<span>SCOTTISH REGALIA.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 208.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The story referred to by Jeremy Taylor reminds me of a somewhat similar
instance of dishonest astuteness I lately heard of in Scotland, from an
old Highlander; the which, though courtesy forbade me to dispute, I at
the time received "cum grano," and have since been unable to verify. It
was as follows:</p>

<p>The custodians (whether rightful or not, I know not, as no date was
assigned to the action of the narrative) of the Scottish regalia being
bound by an oath to deliver it to the Governor of Carlisle, as the
nearest representative of the English sovereign, by a certain day,
determined upon a plan for performing (!), and at the same time evading,
their promise. Having selected the most able steed in Scotland, a
suitable deputation escorted the regalia <em>and the horse</em> to the
appointed place of tradition. The embassy carrying with them the more
valuable and portable of their treasures&mdash;the jewels, not the horse, of
which hereafter,&mdash;were duly admitted to an audience with the governor,
who received them in the presence of the principal inhabitants of
Carlisle: and having produced and surrendered the regalia (and doubtless
taken an acquittance!), surreptitiously, and with gipsey adroitness,
regained possession of it, and conveying it from the audience chamber,
immediately delivered it to an expectant messenger; who, mounted on the
before-mentioned horse, awaited its return outside the hall; and who,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ventre à terre</i>, pursued his eager flight across the border, nor once
drew rein until his precious burden was again deposited in the custody
of Scottish tenure. Whether the deputation was dismissed, and escaped
before the discovery of its chicanery, or whether the conspirators
received the well-merited punishment of their audacious dissimulation,
my informant knew not. And although the story tells more in favour of
the astuteness than<a id="Page_444"></a> <span class="pagenum">[444]</span> the honesty of his countrymen (if true), he
narrated it with considerable unction, and declared that it was
generally believed and admired in Scotland; the patriotism displayed,
the dangerous nature of the enterprise, and the success which attended
it, palliating any stigma which might attach to the want of faith,
double dealing, and casuistry which marked the transaction.</p>

<p>The method by which the horse's title to be considered the ablest in
Scotland was ascertained, was ingenious. The horses the most renowned
for fleetness and endurance were secretly collected, and having been
deprived of water for a considerable time, were presently, one by one,
permitted to bury their heads in the grateful bucket, and the duration
of each draught was scrupulously watched and recorded; the animal that
retained its nostrils for the longest time immersed being selected for
the honour of rescuing the royal treasure, as having given proofs of its
superior wind and bottom.</p>

<p>Is any credit to be attached to the story: and if historical, can any
reader inform me where it is recorded?</p>

<p>From these passages it will be seen that the gods dwelt in these groves,
and that sacred vessels and altars were placed there, but no images;
neither were temples erected.<a id="ted2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The practice of worshipping the gods in
woods and trees continued for many centuries, till the introduction of
Christianity (Vid. Willibald, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 786, <cite>in Vita Bonifacii</cite>), and the
converters did not disdain to adopt every means to raise Christian
cultus to higher authority than that of Paganism, by acting upon the
senses of the heathen, <i>e.g.</i> using white robes for those baptized,
lighting of candles, burning of incense, &amp;c.; and they erected the
Christian churches, for the most part, upon the site of Pagan <em>tree</em> or
temple; Sulp. <cite>Severus</cite> (ed. Amst. 1665), p. 485.:</p>

<p>The heathen gods were represented as impotent, in opposition to the true

inimical evil powers, which must submit, but could nevertheless exercise
a certain hurtful influence.</p>

<p>Some heathen traditions and superstitions remained, their names only
being altered into those of Christ, Maria, and the saints. In this
manner they spared the assuefactions of the people, and made them
believe that the sacredness of the place was not lost, but henceforth
depended on the presence of the true God.</p>

<h3>
<span>MITIGATION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO A FORGER.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 434.)</span>
</h3>


<p>The case related by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span> is interesting, but requires sifting.
Perhaps he will be good<a id="Page_445"></a> <span class="pagenum">[445]</span> enough to do it, or to put me on the
trail. As the energetic sister may be a reader of "N. &amp; Q.," I do not
wish to annoy her by printing the forger's name, but I shall be glad to
have the place and date of the conviction.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, the rule of hanging for forgery was broken in
the case of Fry, a school-master, who was sentenced to death without any
hope of mercy, and not reprieved till he had heard the "condemned
sermon"&mdash;I think, not till the day before that which was fixed for his
execution. He showed great fear; rolled upon the chapel floor, and
delivered to the sheriffs a well-written protest against the right to
inflict capital punishment. His being spared caused much surprise; and
between that event and the abolition of the punishment of death for
forgery, few, if any, were executed for that crime.</p>

<p>The sister, falling, at the feet of Baron G&mdash;&mdash;, who "was notorious for
his unflinching obduracy," is a melo-dramatic event which, I think,
would have found its way to the newspapers. But the most extraordinary
thing is the conclusion:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "The forger was placed in the hulks prior to transportation; and
   before this took place he had forged a pass or order from the
   Home Secretary's office for his own liberation, which procured
   his release, and he was never afterwards heard of."</p>

<p>Letters to convicts in the hulks are opened by the officers before being
delivered to the prisoners. It is not usual for the Home Secretary to
write to a convict enclosing "a pass or order." On the contrary, a
pardon is attended with a good number of formalities, and without one I
do not think that any convict would have been allowed to quit the
vessel. In that class of prisoners, leave of absence on parole, or a
"day rule," would have been something peculiar enough to make the
turnkey ask, "Where did you get this?" In short, a convict who made his
escape as described must be as extraordinary a person as the strong
American, who could sit in a basket and lift himself upon a table by the
handles.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "She returned to the city at which the assizes had been held just
   as they were concluded. The two judges were in the act of

<p>It is usual for the judges to attend divine service on the
commission-day if they arrive soon enough, or the day after if they do
not. If a Sunday occur during the sitting of the commission, they also
attend; but I never knew, and on inquiring I cannot hear, that they ever
so attended at the close of the assizes, when they are always glad to
get on to the next town, if the circuit is not concluded, and away
altogether if it is.</p>

<h3>
<span>LORDS MARCHERS OF WALES.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 30. 135. 189.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Allow me to call upon your correspondent I. J. H. H., who dates from St.
Asaph, to explain what he means by a Lordship Marcher; and what proof he
possesses that his friend Mr. Lloyd is the "only Lord Marcher now extant
in the kingdom?" The most authentic single record which we possess of
the number, names, and situation of these lordships is the statute 27
Hen. VIII. ch. 26. The writs issued to the Lords Marchers, at various
times before that statute, would perhaps furnish materials for a more
exact enumeration of them; but the above Act was unquestionably intended
to include all of them; and the only reason why the information conveyed
by it is not complete is, that some of the names specified in it may
perhaps be those of townships, or other districts within, or parcel of,
some Lordship Marcher, and that other lordships seem to be comprehended
under a general description, such as "all lordships lying between
Chepstow Bridge and Gloucestershire." Hence, the number of real
Lordships Marchers may, <em>perhaps</em>, be fewer or more than are there
mentioned. Herbert, in his <cite>History of Henry VIII.</cite>, says that there
were 141 Lordships Marchers. (Kennett's <cite>Compl. Hist.</cite>, vol. ii. p.
189.)</p>

<p>The lordship of Kemes is not, I think, specified in the Act; but I
presume that it is comprehended within some of the descriptions of
lordships in it. Probably it is included in sect. 16. In old writs of
summons to attend the King in his wars, Kemes is associated with Dyvett
or with Llandovery.</p>

<p>The statute referred to did, in fact, extinguish the most characteristic
privileges of a Lordship Marcher, and reduced it nearly to the level of
an ordinary lordship, with such royalties only as have often been
granted, and are still enjoyed, by Lords of Manors, or honours in other
parts of England and Wales. The franchises left to them are enumerated
in sections 25. and 30., explained by the later statute 1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp;
Mary, ch. 15. The palatine jurisdiction which they once possessed, and
the exemption from ordinary process, exist no longer; and the various
local customs prevailing in each lordship, which were repugnant to the
common law of England, must have been almost wholly abolished by the
operation of that Act. The lordships themselves remain in name, and in
little more than in name.</p>

<p>Hence I am afraid that I. J. H. H.'s friend must be prepared to
surrender the distinction of being the sole surviving Lord Marcher. In
the strict and original sense of the term, there is now no such lordship
in existence. In the sense in which alone the title can now be assumed,
he shares the honour with many others; among others, with the Duke of
Beaufort, who holds the very extensive and important Marcher Seignory of
Gower and Kilvey.<a id="Page_446"></a> <span class="pagenum">[446]</span></p>

<p>Probably the number of private lordships of this kind is not now great;
for, at the passing of the above statute, the majority were in the
Crown; and if any have since been re-granted, it is most likely that
their franchises and tenure would be so modified as to leave no vestige
of the Marcher privileges in them.</p>

<p>The statement of your correspondent suggests to me another doubt. How
could any Lordship Marcher be "erected by Martin of Tours?" Every such
lordship must be of the creation of the Crown, either shown or presumed.
The date of the establishment of these marcherships is so ancient that,
perhaps, no one may have actually seen any document to prove them but
charters of confirmation and inquisitions post-mortem; still the <em>law</em>
refers their origin to specific Crown grants, and not to the act or
authority of a mere subject. If, therefore, Martin, who was a tenant in
capite of the Crown, founded the lordship of Kemes, he must have
done&mdash;as the military invaders of Ireland in a subsequent reign
did&mdash;conquered the territory with his own arms, and obtained palatine
jurisdiction over it, with the assent and by the authority of the King.</p>

<p>Let me add, that the MS. treatise in the Harleian Collection (referred
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</i>, p. 135.) is printed in Pennant's <cite>Wales</cite>, and, more
correctly, in vol. ii. of the <cite>Transactions of the Cymmrodorion
Society</cite>. It is much to be lamented that the treatise on the Lordships
Marchers, bequeathed by Sir Matthew Hale to the Society of Lincoln's
Inn, is not to be found in that library. If the work was composed by
that eminent judge himself, it must be one of the highest value and
authority. Does any one possess it, or a copy of it?</p>

<p>5. "That others have done so even after death upon a re-union of their

<h3>
<span>CAN A CLERGYMAN MARRY HIMSELF?<br />
(Vol. v., p. 370.)</span>
</h3>


<p>A Query has been put respecting a clergyman marrying himself. Such a
thing did once occur in the case of the Rev. J. D. T. M. F&mdash;&mdash;g, curate
of the parish of S&mdash;&mdash;n M&mdash;&mdash;t, Somersetshire. The parish register
informs us that&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot">"On three several Sundays, namely, on the 22nd and 29th days of
   July, and the 5th August in the year<a id="Page_447"></a> <span class="pagenum">[447]</span> 1787, banns of
   marriage were published in the parish church between J. D. T. M.
   F&mdash;&mdash;g and H. V. B&mdash;&mdash;t; and after the third publication, no
   impediment being alleged, the said J. D. T. M. F&mdash;&mdash;g and H. V.
   B&mdash;&mdash;t were <em>immediately</em> married in the face of the
   congregation, on the 5th of August, 1787, by J&mdash;&mdash;n F&mdash;&mdash;g
   curate."</p>


<p>The parties' names are appended to the form "This marriage was
solemnised between us;" and then follows, "in the presence of" two
witnesses who signed their names, one of them being the "clark," as he
spelt the word. The event occurred "on a Sacrament Sunday." An aged
parishioner, who was about seventy-four or seventy-five years of age
when my informant wrote, perfectly remembered the ceremony; and added,
that previously to Mr. F.'s return from the Lord's Table to the reading
desk, in order to continue the service, from the Second Lesson, he
exchanged a kiss with his blushing bride! It appears that, owing to
several persons having disputed the <em>validity</em> of this marriage, the
said parties were re-married by the Rev. W. N&mdash;&mdash;s, officiating
minister, on the 9th October in the same year.</p>

<p>I have heard that Mr. F. was always regarded as an eccentric man, if not
deranged. I think I have heard that the bride was a milk girl, with whom
the reverend gentleman fell in love because "she reminded him of his
first love!" The marriage was decidedly opposed by his relatives and
friends, which led to the above-mentioned singular occurrence. I
believe, before performing the ceremony himself, Mr. F. publicly
inquired "whether there was any one provided to marry him?" As there was
not, he proceeded to the performance of the ceremony himself.</p>

<p>I have heard also of some such case of a clergyman marrying himself in
Ireland. But the marriage was, I believe, pronounced null and void, and
the clergyman deposed from the ministry.</p>

<p>Connected with this subject, I would relate another circumstance related
to me as a fact by a clergyman, now a surrogate, who for very many years
was curate of the parish adjoining that in which it occurred. He related
it to justify and to explain his own somewhat unusual practice of using
the <em>surnames</em> as well as Christian names of the parties throughout the
Marriage Service, saying that in the parish of B&mdash;&mdash;y, Gloucestershire,
the not doing so led to the <em>wrong couple being married</em>, owing to the
stupidity of the parties and their friends! The rector, Rev. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;d,
on discovering the mistake, formally pronounced the whole proceeding
null and void, and then married the right couple!</p>

<p>A correspondent lately inquired whether a person could be buried in a
garden! In N&mdash;&mdash;h, Gloucestershire, such a thing occurred about sixteen
years ago. An eccentric old gentleman built a kind of summer-house in
his garden, and prepared his own tomb in it, and was there buried
according to his directions. I rather think the funeral service was
read, under the express sanction of the bishop, by the rector of an
adjoining parish, who was a friend of the deceased.</p>

<h4>
<span>Algernon Sydney</span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 318. 426.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I can hardly suppose that
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H. D<span class="smcap lowercase">IXON</span> can have made any progress in his inquiries as to Algernon
Sydney, without having met with the "authorities" mentioned by your
correspondent C. E. D.; and yet it is certainly strange that, if
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. D<span class="smcap lowercase">IXON</span> had seen these authorities, he could have called Sydney "an
<em>illustrious patriot</em>." It may be therefore as well to state that the
specific evidence which destroys Sydney's claim to the title not merely
of an "<em>illustrious patriot</em>," but even of <em>an honest man</em>, and shows
him to have been a corrupt traitor of the worst class, is to be found in
the Appendix to Sir John Dalrymple's <cite>Memoirs</cite>, vol. i. pp. 339. 386.
(8vo edit. 1790), where are transcribed the secret despatches of the
French ambassador, Barillon, to Louis XIV., detailing the <em>bribes</em> by
which he engaged Algernon Sydney to that factious and traitorous
opposition which had, for a hundred years prior to Dalrymple's
publication, passed off for <em>patriotism</em>. I shall be very curious indeed
to see what light M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H. D<span class="smcap lowercase">IXON</span> may be able to throw on this curious and
infamous case; of which the best that even Mr. Macaulay can say is, that
Barillon's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">louis d'ors</i> were "a temptation which conquered the virtue

<p>&mdash;It may be doubted whether
Mr. Faber will thank J. R. R. for republishing his absurd blunder. It
must not, however, be allowed to gain a settlement in "N. &amp; Q.," or to
pass for a real explanation, while it is in reality one of the most
unfortunate "cock-and-bull" stories that ever was invented. The truth
is, that Reinerius, a writer of the Middle Ages, lays it to the charge
of the Waldenses that they did not hold the traditions of the Church
and, by way of instance, he specifies that they did <em>not</em> believe (as,
he took for granted, all his orthodox readers <em>did</em>) that the cock on
the church steeple was symbolical of a doctor or teacher. Reinerius did
not think of adding a word of explanation about its overlooking the
parish from its elevated position, or of its prescriptive right from the
days of St. Peter to do a pastor's office by reminding men of the duty
of repentance, or of any of the things which writers on symbolism had
said, or might say. He nakedly states, "Item, mysticum sensum in divinis
scripturis refutant: præcipue in dictis et actis ab Ecclesia traditis:
ut quod gallus super campanile significat Doctorem."<a id="Page_448"></a> <span class="pagenum">[448]</span> Mr. Faber,
who was somewhat out of his way in dealing with the thoughts and

blundered between a <em>bell</em> and a <em>belfry</em>, put <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campanum</i> for
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campanile</i>, and thus got an idea of a "cock-on-a-bell," and that this

Humanity in the University of Edinburgh, 1625. Appointed Rector of the

<span>Theological Tract&mdash;The Huntyng of the Romish Fox</span>

<h4>
<span>Moke</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 374).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;With the Editor of "N. &amp; Q." I think the
interpretation of "muck" for the old word used by Wyckliffe is "not
satisfactory:" I therefore suggest another, perhaps equally
questionable. Every rustic in grazing districts knows, that in the hot
season of the year sheep are liable to be fearfully flyblown in their
living flesh; and that the maggots thence resulting are called <em>mokes</em>,
or mawks. Is not the preacher's allusion in the text to certain
shepherds, or rather sheep of Christ's flock, who, rather than give one
of their <em>mokes</em> to help one of their "needy brethren," will allow
themselves to "perish" and "be taken of" these maggots? The term in
question is, or was formerly, in provincial use as a metonym for
lendiculosity in a figurative sense&mdash;a tetchy, whimsical individual,
being said to be "maggoty," <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vulgo</i>, <em>mokey</em>. Lendix has not, however,
in all cases been treated with abhorrence; for one of the elder Wesleys
not only printed a book of rhymes with the title of <cite>Maggots</cite>, but
prefixed to it his portrait, with one of these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animi impetu concitari</i>

<span>Nobleman alluded to by Bishop Berkeley</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 345.).</span>

<p>&mdash;I beg to
suggest to your correspondent J. M., that this nobleman was Richard
Boyle, third Earl of Burlington, and fourth Earl of Cork, who had a
passion for architecture, and was the architect of numerous buildings in
the metropolis and other parts of the kingdom. He repaired Inigo Jones's
church of St. Paul, Covent Garden. He built the front of Burlington
House in Piccadilly; the dormitory at Westminster School; the Assembly
Rooms at York; and several villas and mansions in various parts of the
country, besides publishing some architectural works. Bishop Berkeley
was introduced to him by Pope about the year 1722, and I believe derived
some benefit from his patronage. His architectural pursuits are alluded
to by Pope in the epistle on the use of riches, which was addressed to
him.</p>

<p>I am the owner of the house referred to, and have lived here since 1811.
I have never heard the report, but I think that it may have arisen from
the fact, that about eighty years ago a Major <em>Denham</em> possessed the

<h4>
<span>The Iron Plate in Lewes Castle</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 342.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In answer to A. W.
I beg to say that the iron plate was taken from the ruins of a cottage
which was burnt down on the estate of Sir Henry Shiffner some time
since; it formed the fire-back of the kitchen: the inscription was
turned to the wall, and therefore not visible.</p>

<p>This inscription is a fac-simile of the iron plate placed to the memory
of Ann Forster in the church of Crowhurst in Surrey, and it would appear
that the founder cast several plates similar to that in Lewes Castle,
which are known to exist and be used as fire-backs. See Brayley and
Britton's <cite>History of Surrey</cite>, vol. iv. p. 131., and note at foot of the
same page.</p>

  <p class="right">   W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILLIAM</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">IGG</span>.</p>

  <p class="left">  Lewes.</p>




<p>The monumental (cast iron?) plate in Lewes castle, referred to by A. W.,
probably came from the church of Crowhurst in Surrey, where there are
several monuments to members of the family of Gaynsford, and there were
(in Sept. 1847, when I visited the building) more than one iron plate in
the pavement with inscriptions of the exact character of that at Lewes,
and with the letters similarly inverted and reversed. My impression is
that I saw the memorial in question in the church; but I cannot now
discover the notes I made on the subject at the time, nor a rubbing
which I took of another iron plate of a more ornate though not less rude
character. I remember, in passing within sight of the church on the
Dover Railway, since 1847, to have noticed scaffolding about the tower;
possibly the plate now at Lewes may have been removed at that time.</p>

 <p class="right">  R. C. H.</p>


<p>The plate was presented to the Antiquarian Museum in Lewes Castle by Sir
H. Shiffner, Bart., about two years ago, when he rescued it from a
farm-house burnt down on his property near Lewes. It has been traced to
a cottage where it previously served the same purpose as at the
farm-house, as back to the fire-place; but no further record of its
former history can be discovered. It is not unusual, however, to find
monumental plates thus desecrated.</p>

originally have been Ceolwoldsburh or Ceolweardesburh, i.e. <em>the burgh</em>

<span>Key Experiments</span>
<span>(Vol v., pp. 152. 293.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In an edition of <cite>Hudibras</cite>
of 1704 appears the following "annotation" to the line "As Friar Bacon's
noddle was:"&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "The tradition of Friar Bacon and the Brazen-head is very
   commonly known, and considering the times he lived in, is not
   much more strange than what another great philosopher of his name
   has since deliver'd of a ring that, being ty'd in a string, and
   held like a pendulum in the middle of a silver bowl, will vibrate
   of itself, and tell exactly against the sides of the divining-cup
   the same thing with, Time is, Time was, &amp;c."</p>


<p>I have tried this experiment with the ring, and find the oscillation
takes place as described by A<span class="smcap lowercase">GMOND</span> with the shilling. If, however, the
thread is tightly pressed between the finger and thumb, the vibration
ceases. This latter circumstance appears to support AGMOND'S idea, that
the motive power is due to the pulse, the circulation of the blood
ceasing by pressure.</p>

This is by no means the case. It is a jetton, or counter, such as was
formerly much in use for casting accounts, on a principle very similar
to that of the abacus. They are found in vast numbers in England, but
were principally manufactured at Nuremberg, where a large trade in them
must have been carried on. The greatest manufacturers of the
"Rechenpfennige" were the members of the families of Schultz, Laufer,
and Krauwinckel. Of the three Krauwinckels, the productions of Hans are
most numerous. Many of them have legends of a moral or religious
character, as "Gottes Segen macht reich," God's blessing maketh rich;
"Gott allein die Ehre sey," To God alone be the glory; "Heut rodt,
Morgen todt," To-day <em>red</em>, to-morrow dead, &amp;c. The date 1601 occurs on
several of those of Hans K., with mythological devices.&mdash;See Snelling's

<p>&mdash;The monuments
referred to by Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> are in the church of Aldworth: the effigies are
certainly<a id="Page_451"></a> <span class="pagenum">[451]</span> remarkable, especially one for its size and attitude.
Another noticeable circumstance is that most of the figures are of older
date than the tombs on which they lie, or than the church which contains
them. The building consists of a nave and south aisle; and, at the time
of its original construction, three canopied recessed tombs were
introduced in each of the side walls to receive the effigies which must
have existed in the older church. The style of the architecture belongs
to the age of Edward III. There are nine figures altogether, some of
them greatly mutilated. They are not entirely unknown to archæologists.</p>

<p>I may take this opportunity of calling attention to another very fine
monumental effigy, of which I believe no moderately good representation
has been published, at Tilton in Leicestershire. There are two figures
in the church of as early dates as those at Aldworth, one an armed male,
and the other a female. The former is in "edgering" mail, and is of good
character; but the latter is of superior design, and very well executed,
though unfortunately in a coarse material. The right arm is bent, and
the hand brought up to the breast; the left hangs naturally by the side,
and has the fore-arm and (bare) hand exposed from among the folds of the
drapery. Slight traces of colour are discoverable.</p>

<p>The village of Aldworth, in Berkshire, where the effigies of the De la
Beche family are to be seen, is about five miles from the Goring
Station, on the Great Western Railway, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Streatley. Hewett's
<cite>Hundred of Compton</cite> furnishes a very interesting account of the ten
monumental effigies which represent various members of the ancient
family of De la Beche in that church, and will be read with no small
pleasure.</p>

<p>J. H. L. (Vol. iv., p. 76.) adduces the instance of <em>Cowper</em> being made

<h4>
<span>Monumental Portraits</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 349.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Fully agreeing with my
friend H. H. in his opinion of the brass of the Abbess of Elstow,
considered as a portrait, I should yet be glad if your correspondents
would send to "N. &amp; Q." the names of any effigies which may appear to
them exceptions to the rule of conventional portraiture, especially if
of earlier date than the latter half of the sixteenth century. H. H. has
mentioned one, Nicholas Canteys, 1431, at Margate: and I am inclined to
add another in the well-executed little brass of Robert de Brentingham
at East Horsley, Surrey; this is about the date of 1380. The artists of
that time, in brasses as well as in painted glass, wood-carving, &amp;c.,
may have sometimes desired to produce a portrait, but certainly they
seldom succeeded: a religious severity of expression atoned for the
deficiency. In English coins it is well known that there is no
appearance of a portrait before the reign of Henry VII.</p>

<p>The particular <em>costume</em>, however, of the deceased was more attended to
in monumental effigies; and it is this fact which renders the study of
them so serviceable towards a knowledge of the manners and habits of our
ancestors. Care was even taken not to omit any peculiarity which may
have distinguished the deceased; of which the long beard of Sir Wm.
Tendring, at Stoke, by Layland, is perhaps an instance, and many others
might be quoted. If any decided portraits are known in <em>stone effigies</em>,
it would I think be desirable to communicate such to the pages of "N. &amp;
Q."</p>

<h4>
<span>Motto on Chimney-piece</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 345.)</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It does not appear to me
that the mottoes sent by your inquirer C. T. are very difficult to
solve. The first is Latin:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "VITATRANOVULAESTOLIM."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">He says he is not certain as to one or two letters. I suspect the first
<span class="smaller">O</span> should be
<span class="smaller">Q</span>, and the
 <span class="smaller">V</span> should be
<span class="smaller">I</span>. It will then read:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Vita tranquila est olim."</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

   <p> "Life is henceforth tranquil."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">A very proper motto for a fire-side.</p>

<p>The second is Italian:</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p>   "VE DAL AM DARO."</p>

</div>

<p>I suspect the <span class="smaller">R</span> should be
 <span class="smaller">T</span>. It will then read:</p>

 <div class="poem">

  <p>"Ve da'l amico dato."</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

 <p> "Given to you by the friend."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If the word is <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">daro</i>, it will be&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">

 <p>"I will give it to you from the friend."</p>

<p>The arms given by your correspondent C. T. are those of Cavendish
(quartering Clifford), one of that family having been created Earl of
Newcastle in 1610. Becoming shortly after extinct, John Holles, Earl of
Clare (who had married the heiress of Cavendish), was created by King
William III. in 1694 Marquis of Clare and Duke of Newcastle.<a id="Page_452"></a> <span class="pagenum">[452]</span></p>

<p>Might not the chimney-piece have adorned a mansion of the Cavendish
family, who probably resided in Newcastle during the period above
alluded to?</p>

<p>The motto underneath (which is <em>not</em> the family motto of Cavendish)
certainly at first sight looks puzzling enough; will the following
solution suffice, which I merely throw out as a first thought that may
lead to a better elucidation?</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Vita : tran : ovula : est : olim."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Presuming "ovula" to be the diminutive of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ovum</i> (I am not sure if I am
correct), and "tran" (if correctly transcribed) to be a component part
of one of the numerous compounds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trans</i> (say <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transitorius</i>), may
not the passage be <em>freely</em> translated: "(Our) transitory life (was)
once (as mysterious, or hidden, or minute as) is (the germ of vitality)
in an egg?"</p>

<p>If C. T. could give a description of the second coat, some connecting
link may possibly be supplied toward unravelling the motto.</p>

<p>&mdash;The brasses of John

Church, Bucks; and of a priest at St. Peter's, near St. Alban's, have
this inscription upon them:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Ecce quod expendi habui, quod donavi habeo, quod negavi punior,
   quod servavi perdidi."</p>

<p>That at St. Alban's has an English translation:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Lo, all that ever I spent, that sometime had I;</p>
      <p>All that I gave in good intent, that now have I;</p>

feeding her young with her own blood: an emblem of Christ's love for His

<h4>
<span>The Term "Milesian"</span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 175.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I beg to direct your
attention to the accompanying extract, which furnishes a reply to
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER'S</span> Query:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "Whoever is acquainted with Irish history, or whoever has had
   opportunities of mixing with the natives of that country, cannot
   be ignorant that they claim a descent from a long race of
   Milesian kings, who reigned over them for thirteen centuries
   before the Christian æra. The stock from which this long line of
   monarchs emanated is traced to a pretended Milesian colony,
   supposed to have emigrated from Spain into Ireland under the
   conduct of Heremon and Heber. The most rational inquirers,
   however, into the subject consider it as nothing more than a
   tissue of imaginary events, originating in the fertile fancies of
   their bards. A very brief and general abstract of this contested
   part of Irish history shall be given in the words of Mr. Plowden:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "'About 140 years after the Deluge, Ireland was discovered by one
   Adhua, who had been sent from Asia to explore new countries by a
   grandson of Belus: he plucked some of the luxuriant grass as a
   specimen of the fertility of the soil, and returned to his
   master. After that the island remained unoccupied for 140 years;
   and about 300 years after the Flood, one Partholan, originally a
   Scythian, and a descendant from Japhet in the sixth generation,
   sailed from Greece with his family and 1000 soldiers, and took
   possession of the island. They all died off, and left the island
   desolate of human beings for the space of thirty years.
   Afterwards different sets of emigrant adventurers occupied and
   peopled the island at different periods. About 1080 years after
   the Deluge, and 1300 <span class="smaller">B.C</span>., Niul (the son of Phenius, a wise
   Scythian prince), who had married a daughter of Pharaoh,
   inhabited with his people a district given to him by his
   father-in-law on the Red Sea, when Moses led the Israelites out
   of Egypt. The descendants of that Phenius (called more generally
   Feniusa Farsa) were afterwards expelled by Pharaoh's successors
   on account of their ancestors having favoured the escape of the
   Israelites through the Red Sea. They then emigrated and settled
   in Spain, whence, under the command of Milesius, a colony of them
   sailed from Brigantia in Galicia to Ireland, gained the
   ascendancy over the inhabitants, and gave laws and a race of
   monarchs to the island. The Milesian dynasty continued to govern
   Ireland without interruption till about the year 1168, when it
   ceased in the person of Roger O'Connor, and the sovereignty was
   assumed by our Henry II. Of this race of kings the first 110 were
   Pagan, the rest Christian.'"</p>

<h4>
<span>Title of D.D.</span>
<span>(Vol. ii., p. 13.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The remark of your correspondent
E<span class="smcap lowercase">YE</span>-S<span class="smcap lowercase">NUFF</span>, "that any lay scholar of adequate attainments in theology is
competent to receive this distinction, and any university to bestow it
upon him," is incorrect in two ways, as far as the university of which I
am a member is concerned. A reference to the Oxford University Calendar,
or to the Statutes of the University, will show him that no one can take
the degree of B.D., or D.D., without first exhibiting his letters of
priest's orders: and the theological attainments represented by the
degree D.D. are next to nothing; the exercise required for B.D. used to
be a mere form, and I believe is little more now; a certain number of
terms kept in the university, and payment of certain fees, being all
that is necessary for proceeding D.D. The case is the same, I imagine,
at Cambridge.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have heard it argued that the word
<em>bull</em>, meaning an incoherent blunder, was derived from the Pope's
Bulls, the tyrannical contents and imperious tone of which often made so
odd a contrast with the humility of the subscription, "Servus servorum
Dei," that the name <em>bull</em> was applied to anything that seemed absurdly
inconsistent or self-contradictory.</p>

<span>Remains of Horses and Sheep in Churches</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 274.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;We have
good evidence that the Saxons used the places of sepulture which they
found in England; and it is well known that Anglo-Saxon remains have
often been discovered in the vicinity of churches, a fact which leads to
the supposition that churches occupied the sites of Pagan temples. The
bones of animals have often been found on and near the sites of our
London churches.</p>

<h4>
<span>Fern Seed</span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 172. 356.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I am led to think there is an
error in the notice of your correspondent R. S. F. on the above subject.
The seed of St. John's Fearn cannot be gathered on Midsummer Eve,
inasmuch as at that time it is in a merely embryotic state. The seed
attains perfection late in autumn, and it remains attached to the dry
brown stem until shaken off by the autumnal and winter blasts. The
taking of it, therefore, is not, according to those versed in such
mysteries, the easy task of a Midsummer twilight, but must be performed
amid the darkness of a winter's night. On the midnight of Saint John the
Evangelist, to whom the seed and plant are dedicated, must it be shaken,
not pulled, from its stem. Very probably mystic virtues were imputed to
the seed before the introduction of Christianity. And it were not
perhaps hazarding too much to suppose that the old superstitious monks
assigned it to Saint John from an idea that the potency of the seed
might have influenced the wondrous revelations with which he, more than
any other of the disciples, or all the disciples, was favoured.</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>The Camden Society, of which the fourteenth Annual Meeting on Monday
last passed off most successfully, has just issued to its Members <cite>The
Chronicle of The Grey Friars of London</cite>, edited from a MS. in the
Cottonian Library in the British Museum. This very interesting document,
which altogether escaped the research of the industrious and voluminous
Strype, though it had passed through the hands of Stowe, who had either
the possession or the loan of the original MS., was written by one of
the Grey Friars, who appears to have watched narrowly, and recorded
carefully, the religious changes of the times, more particularly, those
which occurred within the sphere of his personal observation in the city
of London, and the metropolitan church of St. Paul. As he retained
possession of his register, and continued his labours after the
dissolution of his house, and the dismissal of the rest of his
fraternity, he has preserved to us many particulars of great historical
value; and his work has this additional claim to attention, that,
whereas the majority of the existing documents are records of the
Reforming party, this comes from one of the Reformed, and presents us
accordingly with the other side of the case. The work is edited by Mr.
J. G. Nichols, whose name is a sufficient guarantee for the fidelity
with which the document is printed, and the learning and care bestowed
upon its illustration.</p>

<p><cite>The Publications of the Antiquarian Etching Club.</cite>&mdash;Part III., 1851,
presents us with no less than thirty-three etchings by Members of the
Club (of course of various degrees of merit), of objects of antiquarian
interest, comprising Ecclesiastical, Military, and Domestic Edifices,
Fonts, Sepulchral Monuments, Portraits, Fac-similes, copies of rare
prints, and numerous other vestiges of antiquity calculated at once to
instruct the archæologist, and preserve in a pictorial form a record of
much which, but for the <em>burins</em> of the members of this useful little
Society, might have been lost for ever.</p>

<p>It is but a few weeks since we noticed the admirable second volume of
the <cite>Catalogue of the London Library</cite>, by Mr. J. G. Cochrane. We have
now to record the death of that gentleman on Tuesday last. He was a most
worthy man, and a good scholar; and possessed a vast fund of
bibliographical knowledge. His death therefore will be felt, not only by
his own immediate friends, but also by the institution which he had
served so ably and so zealously ever since its formation.</p>

<p>It would be treason to the Brothers Grimm, and to our own love of the
literature of the people, if we did not notice and (as it deserves it)
say a good word of a new and complete translation of the world-renowned
<cite>Kinder und Haus Mährchen</cite>, which Messrs. Addey have commenced
publishing under the title of Grimm's <cite>Household Stories</cite>. They are very
faithfully translated from the last edition; and we specify this because
the little <cite>Almaine 4to.</cite> first edition of 1819 has long been one of our
household books, and finding that the translation did not agree with the
versions there given, we have compared it with the edition of 1843, and
so discovered, first, that the translator has used the later edition;
and secondly, what we were not till now aware of, namely, that these
great scholars, Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, amid their more learned
labours, have not disdained to revise and enlarge their collection of
nursery stories, which have been the delight of the children of all
Europe. What a justification is this for the attention which is bestowed
in "N. &amp; Q." on our own English Folk Lore!</p>

<p class="noindent cap">In consequence of many thousands of persons in the United Kingdom having
been unable to obtain a Copy of the GREAT EXHIBITION CHART, printed in
Colours, and presented by the Proprietors of the WEEKLY DISPATCH, to
their Subscribers and the Public, in the months of January and February
last, A RE-ISSUE has been determined upon, to take place on SUNDAY the
16th of MAY. The Chart, which has undergone a careful revision, shows by
simple diagrams the number of persons that visited the Exhibition daily,
the amount of money taken at the various entrances, the quantity of
refreshments consumed; the names of the Royal Commissioners; an account
of the origin of the Palace, and its dimensions in feet. In order that
every individual in the country may possess this statistical reflex of
curious and interesting results, to mark the demolition of the building,
and to serve as a memento of its existence, the Chart will be delivered
GRATIS to every Subscriber and Purchaser of the DISPATCH on the day
stated.</p>
